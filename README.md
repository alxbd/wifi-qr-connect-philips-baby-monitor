# Philips Baby Monitor WiFi QR Code Generator

Generate QR codes to connect your Philips Baby Monitor to WiFi without the official app.

*A quick 1-hour project to scratch my own itch. Don't dig too deep.*

## Why?

If you travel with your baby monitor (grandparents’ house, vacation house, travel router Wi-Fi, etc.), reconnecting it to the WiFi network through the official app can be slow and frustrating.

This tool lets you generate QR codes and print or save them on your phone, so when you arrive at each location, you simply scan and connect without going through the app setup process each time.

## How it works

1. Enter your WiFi name and password
2. Generate the QR code
3. On the monitor, hold NIGHTLIGHT + LULLABY buttons for 3 seconds
4. Show the QR code to the camera
5. For later use: print the QR code or save it to your phone

## Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```
## QR Code format

The format was reverse-engineered by scanning a QR code generated by the official Philips app. Turns out it's just plain JSON:

```json
{"s":"<SSID>","p":"<PASSWORD>","t":"000000000000"}
```

The `t` field seems to be a token that's always zeros.
